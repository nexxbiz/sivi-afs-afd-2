## SIVI All Finance Standard

SIVI AFS is the foundation for a digital ecosystem where customers can receive good service within the various distribution forms. It ensures good access to data and enables data exchange. Moreover, it facilitates digital collaboration with room for individual differences. This is an ambitious goal and will require attention and effort from the industry in the coming years. Simultaneously, it's a necessary agenda because an open digital ecosystem within our industry is a prerequisite for further development and innovation.

The aim of the SIVI All Finance Standard is to support digital business within financial services broadly. In this context, SIVI identifies three perspectives:

- **Data exchange**
- **Data registration**
- **Development of services**

All data-related agreements are documented in the All Finance Data Catalog (AFD). All agreements related to functions and processes are documented within the All Finance API framework (AFA).

### Overview of this project
This set of methods is designed to validate certain aspects of data structures, specifically focusing on verifying the presence, uniqueness, and validity of `refKey` references. These references are common in nested data structures, where entities refer to others by a unique identifier.

---

### Validation Results Structure

Before diving into the validation methods, let's understand the `validationResults` structure. This object is used to store and return validation results from the validation methods.

```javascript
const validationResults = {
    passed: true,
    errors: [],
    errorCount: 0,
};
```

- `passed`: A boolean indicating whether the validation passed without errors.
- `errors`: An array of error objects, each detailing a specific validation error.
- `errorCount`: A count of the total errors encountered.

---

### `validateAfdRefKey(obj, validationResults, path='')`

This method focuses on the validation of the `refKey` property within arrays in an object. It ensures:

1. The `refKey` property is present.
2. The `refKey` is not empty.
3. The `refKey` is unique within its scope.

**Parameters**:
- `obj`: The object to validate.
- `validationResults`: An existing results object where validation findings will be stored.
- `path`: Current traversal path (used mainly for recursion and error reporting).

**Example**:

```javascript
const data = {
    items: [
        { refKey: "A", name: "Item A" },
        { refKey: "B", name: "Item B" },
        { name: "Item without refKey" },
        { refKey: "B", name: "Duplicate Item B" }
    ]
};

validateAfdRefKey(data, validationResults);
```

The above example will report errors for the missing `refKey` and the duplicate `refKey`.

---

### `getValueFromPath(data, path)`

This utility method is used to retrieve values from a specified path within an object. It's especially useful when the path traverses both object properties and array indices.

**Parameters**:
- `data`: The root data object.
- `path`: A string specifying the path from which to retrieve values.

**Returns**:
An array of values found at the specified path.

**Example**:

```javascript
const data = {
    group: {
        items: [{ refKey: "A" }, { refKey: "B" }]
    }
};

const values = getValueFromPath(data, "group.items");
console.log(values);  // Outputs: [{ refKey: "A" }, { refKey: "B" }]
```

---

### `validateAfdReferences(data, fromPath, toPath, validationResults)`

This method is designed to validate references between two paths in a data structure. It ensures that every reference in the source path exists in the target path's `refKeys`.

**Parameters**:
- `data`: The main data object.
- `fromPath`: The path pointing to the source of the references.
- `toPath`: The path pointing to the target where references should exist.
- `validationResults`: An existing results object where validation findings will be stored.

**Example**:

```javascript
const data = {
    user: [
        { refKey: "U1", name: "John", groupRef: ["G1"] },
        { refKey: "U2", name: "Jane", groupRef: ["G2", "G3"] }
    ],
    group: [
        { refKey: "G1", name: "Admins" },
        { refKey: "G2", name: "Users" }
    ]
};

validateAfdReferences(data, "user", "group", validationResults);
```

The above example will report an error because the user "Jane" has a reference to a non-existent group "G3".

---

These methods together form a robust system for validating and ensuring the integrity of nested data structures with `refKey` references.
The referencing key property must conform with the logic ```{object-name}Ref```. E.g., ```group``` reference in ```user```, will be ```groupRef```.
